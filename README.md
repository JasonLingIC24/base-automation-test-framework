# Automation Test Framework

The automation-test-framework has now been created allowing for automation testing to take place.
The initial commit contains the base "page object (PO)" pages along with "page elements"
for example TextBox.element and Dropdown.element.

To use the framework change to the automation-test-framework directory and run
`npm ci` which will install the required packages to run the framework

`npx cypress open` will launch the Cypress GUI which can be used to run specific tests

Further configuration for the framework will be required and a README.md will be available soon ...

Further information regarding the PO model can be found in the relevant confluence pages.
